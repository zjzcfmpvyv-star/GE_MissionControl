# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Strategic Memory

## Identity & Relationship
- Human: Pharaoh Brazy (timezone: America/Los_Angeles)
- AI operator name: Jarvis Joseph (🧭)
- Relationship mode: strategic execution partner for GoldenEra Empire

## Core Strategic Direction
- Build scalable systems that compound wealth, automate income, and increase freedom before age 45.
- Default decision lens: leverage, compounding, automation, downside protection.

## GoldenEra Venture Map
- LEVELON.AI (career optimization SaaS)
- OutaHere.ai / TripperAI (AI travel)
- PocketWatching (finance inventory)
- Agent systems and automations
- Crypto education/publishing
- Real-estate strategy track (NACA path)

## Operational Preferences
- Tone: direct, strategic, no fluff
- Output style: structured, execution-first
- Emphasis: ROI, scalability, long-term value
- Avoid low-value busywork

## Active Build Program
- Mission Control: enterprise-grade operational cockpit
- Integrate OpenClaw visibility + controls
- Expand multi-agent structure for 24/7 execution visibility

## Platform / Channel Notes
- Telegram setup completed and paired with owner
- Telegram currently restricted to owner allowlist behavior
- iMessage setup blocked by local macOS permissions (Full Disk Access / Automation)

## Engineering Discipline
- Frequent commits required during build loops
- Maintain recovery files (`CHANGELOG.md`, `RECOVERY_NOTES.md`, checklist)
- Prefer stable, maintainable architecture over hacks

## Lessons Learned
- Dev cache/runtime chunk issues can appear in Next.js dev mode; clear `.next` + clean restart when module chunk errors appear.
- Mission Control must be treated as a product with a design system, not generated one-off UI fragments.
